# Stroop task Investigation
Used statistics to draw valid conclusions about data

## Overview
In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. We will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret our results in terms of our hypotheses.

## What I've learned
* How to identify components of an experiment
* How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
* How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
